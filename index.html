  <h1>
    From The Ashes She Became
  </h1>
<p>
  Before she became fire, she was water. <br>
  Quenching the thirst of every dying creature.
<br> She gave and she gave<br>
  untilshe turned from sea to desert.<br>
  But instead of dying of the heat,<br>
  the sadness, the heartache,<br>
  she took all of her pain<br>
  and from her own ashes became fire.<br><br>
